      Noodles and Company was started by Aaron Kennady and if there's one value that Aaron treasures, it's loyalty.
      The more a customer visits, the more discounts he or she will be rewarded with the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.olo.noodles">rewards app</a>. The longer an employee
      works within their buisness, the more health and employee benefits they will recieve. On top of that,
      Noodles also values charity. Just recently they gave out free sharables to anyone who would donate
      to the No Kids Hungry Foundation with their purchase. Now, they are holding a turkey drive for Thanksgiving.
      Not to mention the past canned food drive they also held in the past. It may not benefit the immediate
      community, but it seems like the corporate higher really try to move past the stigma of heartless,
      capitalist corporations. The Noodles and Company is a national franchise that trys to support their
      national community.

      There are typically about 15 to 20 employees per store. Usually one general manager and one assistant
      manager, a handful of shift supervisors and the rest are cooks and servers. Starting out, there isn't
      many benefits and you get paid minimum wage, but the longer you work, you can opt in for health
      insurance, stocks, and be able to win scholarships. There is no tip policy, but the owner of the
      franchise says its to keep menu prices low. Employees get a 75% on duty discount, and if they have worked
      for two years, they get a free on duty meal. Generally, employees are rewarded the longer they stay.
